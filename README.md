# Market Architect

Market Architect is a unique and immersive supermarket simulation game where you manage your very own gas station and navigate the complexities of real-world economics. From setting up your market shelves to managing product prices, your decisions shape the success of your business. But it's not just any ordinary simulation; Market Architect incorporates realistic economic systems, including real-life taxes and a bankruptcy system, making it a challenging and strategic business experience.

📖 Game Overview
In Market Architect, you are placed in charge of a small gas station-turned-market. You will be responsible for:

Stocking shelves with various products.
Setting prices to balance profitability and competitiveness.
Serving customers who demand fair prices, fast service, and availability of products.
Your goal is to grow your business into a bustling supermarket, but success won’t come easy. You'll need to strategically manage your in-game currency to pay for operational expenses, handle government-imposed taxes, and even avoid bankruptcy.

💸 Real-Life Taxes System
One of the standout features of Market Architect is its realistic in-game tax system. Just like in the real world, your business will be taxed based on income, sales, and various operations:

Sales Tax: Applied to customer transactions.
Income Tax: Based on your profits at the end of each in-game month.
Other Expenses: Maintenance costs, utilities, and restocking fees will keep you on your toes.
⚖️ Bankruptcy Mechanic
Run out of money? Don't think you can just start over! If your business falls into serious debt, you risk bankruptcy. Going bankrupt will reset parts of your progress, and you’ll have to climb out of the financial hole you’ve dug for yourself. Careful planning and decision-making are essential to stay afloat in the highly competitive supermarket landscape.

🏪 Manage Your Gas Station
Start small with a gas station mini-mart, then build your way up to managing a full-fledged supermarket. You’ll need to consider:

Product Availability: Keep popular products in stock, but don’t overstock items that won’t sell.
Customer Satisfaction: Happy customers mean more return visits, while unhappy ones could spell disaster.
Competition: Price wars with other local businesses can make or break your profit margins.
🔧 Development
The game is being developed using Unity with a focus on realistic economic simulations, and strategic management gameplay.

⚠️ Disclaimer
The game uses in-game currency only for all transactions and features, including taxes and bankruptcy. No real-world money is involved or required for any part of the game.
